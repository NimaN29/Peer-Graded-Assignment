## Description:
In this assignment, the goal was to create a game. A game that would guess the number of files in my current directory.
The README file needed to only include the date and time of when make was run and the number of lines of code contained in the game.
    
    
## What was most challenging:

* Using a variable in WHILE Loop to get the question to repeat.

## What I learned:

* A variable is not always required when using the WHILE Loop.
